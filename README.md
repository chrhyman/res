# The Resistance (res.py)
This is a Python implementation of The Resistance using a `pygame` interface and some server-side JSON.

# Download
Information on how to download will come later. As of now, just `git clone` or fork this repo. You'll need to make sure `pygame` and `requests` are installed on your system, as I don't have make files.
